<p>
The word ‘ikkarai’ means ‘this shore’ in Tamil.  Most Tamil speakers know it from the saying ‘ikkarai-kku akkarai pachai’ which means ‘to this shore the other shore looks green’. This familiar saying is often deployed to remind us that we should work with what we have rather than hankering after seemingly greener pastures.
</p>

<p>
But the saying also challenges a simplistic narrative of progress — that the problems of the present can easily be erased, that we will inevitably move to a glorious future.  Rather, the most uncomfortable and brutal aspects of our human history are still with us today and will be with us in the future.  All of it — from communalism and fellow feeling, to war and love — is here with us on this shore.
</p>

<p>
‘Ikkarai’ is what we all have in common, what belongs to all of us, what we are rooted to, from which we face the sea of the future.  ‘This shore’ can be the balcony overlooking the street.  It can be the tip of your nose, or the outer rim of the galaxy. It can be where we are out of place, where we are in our place. It is simply where we are.
</p>

<p>
But we are often in places where we do not really want to be. Ikkarai, this shore, is a refuge to so many of us who have failed to fit into a mainstream career trajectory, or have drifted away from one, or have reshaped it into something else. This has made us eager to share our experiences with others who might be feeling the same - in particular, children, young adults and youth, who are sometimes forced to fit squares into round holes. We are enthusiastic to work with them towards collectively creating new forms of expression through art, which would fill the gaps that everyday ordinary words leave behind.
