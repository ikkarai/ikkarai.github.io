# The Weight of Joy by Eric Languet -2018

The Weight of Joy was a dance project tackling the notion of handicap and social innovation, created by French choreographer Eric Languet.  It featured a character with a horse head, which he commissioned us to create.

For the base of the horse mask, we used corrugated cardboard and pieces of a thick plastic sheet.

We covered this with cloth and some leather to create the finished mask!
