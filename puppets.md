# Indian String Puppet Collection for Common Threads Boutique (2017)

Inspired by puppets from Rajasthan, this collection of string puppets was created from wire and paper mache.

With just six strings, the puppets were surprisingly expressive!

# Mohini by Seema Hari Kumar (2019)

Mohini was a performance combining classical dance with Pavakathakali puppetry.  We created three types of puppets for the performance.

The puppets can be manipulated with a single hand.

To create these puppets, we began by visiting a traditional Pavakathakali workshop and studying their designs.

We realized wood was too heavy for non experienced performers, so we used paper mache instead to create the body parts.
