We believe there is something inherently disturbing and captivating in the medium of puppet theater:  A means to puncture reality, by breathing life into the seemingly inert, and to tell tales that human mouths are not quite able to utter.


As <i>ikkarai</i>, we design and build puppets, masks, and props for theater and film.  Much of our work has been for own performances, but we love finding new collaboartors and creating commissioned work for other artists.


<i>ikkarai</i> began in Chennai in 2016, as a group of friends sharing a facination with puppetry, and a love for poetry, folk tales, and...mathematics!

We also conduct workshops in puppetry and mask-making, for children, young adults, and anyone else who is interested!
