permalink: /who/

<p>
<i>ikkarai</i> is a refuge to those of us who have not fit into a mainstream career trajectory, or have drifted away from one, or have reshaped it into something else entirely.

This has made us eager to share our experiences with others who might be feeling the same â€” in particular, children, young adults and students.


Our hope is that collectively we can create new forms of expression through art, which can fill the gaps that our everyday routines leave behind.
</p>


<i>ikkarai</i> consists of people from various backgrounds, including theatre, dance, puppetry, textile design, mathematics, and illustration:
